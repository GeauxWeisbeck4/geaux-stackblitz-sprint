# GeauxWeisbeck4 Agile Sprint Site

We are starting this fresh on Week 41 (dates October 10, 2022 - October 16, 2022). I found the sprint weeks on this sick website called [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/weeks/2022). This sprint website will be my public display of my daily sprints - I need to possibly have some more accountability. Even if only a couple people check on it, they can be like "Haaaiii, why haven't you written anything in 3 days? Did you quit? Are you not tough enough for this sprint?"

I'll just be all like "Uhhh, yeah - actually I just kind of wanted to not do it for three days. But it's cool, I'm a hop bright back on top of things and start doing it again. Thanks for the reminder!" 

Don't worry if I seem angry stomping away - it's cause you just really hurt my feelings and self esteem, so I'm going to read books and learn shit to build it back up and use it against you in some way. Maybe I'll call you out on Twitter when you don't do your stupid agile blog. HOW ABOUT THAT!?!?!

## Getting Started

Umm, I promise I'm not crazy, ok? I just take productivity and coding super serious you know? Let's be friends now, ok? Cool, aight - yeah just do this if you need help with your agile skills. Follow me on Twitter or send me an email with a question by subscribing to my newsletter - you must be a newsletter subscriber if you want your question answered. If you become a Ko-Fi Paying member or a Patreon, or Open Collective, you will be my hero and I'll probably do something $*%&ing cool. 

But you just want to get started right? Well here's all the sickest ways to do that:
