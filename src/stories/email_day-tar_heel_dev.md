## Thursday

I need to really hit it hard on emailing potential clients for Tar Heel Dev Studio and get some money rolling in. Today I am going to work on cold emails to my "lead list" - the list that's getting built out today!

I want to work on refining my messsage so that will be another task to add once this one completes (something I want to automate for this sprint system).

# Tasks

- [ ] Research potential Netlify and new Website/Marketing clients
- [ ] Follow along Freelancer guide
- [ ] Send emails
